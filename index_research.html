          Crop Insurance Rate Making, Land Quality and Adverse Selection

           <h3>[Abstract] Over the past two decades, federal government has devoted considerable effort to ensuring that premiums fairly represent the risks and encouraging the participation rates. Through the same duration, U.S. Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP) costs to the Federal Government averaged about $7 billion per year. However, an awkward situation exists that many farmers within a county still felt that their premium rates are too high even after subsidies have been provided. Different from previous studies in terms of loss ratio or loss cost ratio, this study employs large volumes of unit-level yield data and proposes a novel procedure to estimate actuarially fair premium rates. With unit-level insurance records, empirical results show that the mispricing issue, according to our evaluation, does depress participation uptake. </h3>

            Basis Risk and Farmers' Participation in the U.S. Federal Crop Insurance Program: A Conceptual Framework and Its Application</h2>
          </li>
        <ul>
          <h3>[Abstract] In U.S. crop Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP), extensive (insured acres) and intensive (coverage level) margin participation rates take on clear spatial disparities across the Great Plains and Corn Belt. Due to insurance contract design, basis risk which is the variability in the difference between futures prices and spot prices at a location plays a role of a noise source that render the insurance protection less effective. This paper proposes a conceptual framework of the individual decisions and evaluates the effects of basis risk on both participation rates by different econometric strategies. We find that basis risk takes on a distinct region disparity and has a significantly negative effect on both participation rates. Our findings will provide crucial evidence for policy debates regarding crop insurance subsidy reduction and contract design issues.</h3>

          Extensive and Intensive Margins of Irrigation Water Demand in the Great Lakes Region</h2>
        </li>
          <ul>
          <h3>[Abstract] The issues of water withdrawal and induced potential water scarcity in relatively water-rich regions, such as the Great Lakes, has recently emerged as a concern. The data from USDA Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS) and Irrigation and Water Management Survey (IWMS) reveal that there is an upward trend in irrigated water demand from 2003 to 2018 in the Great Lakes region. This study explores the water cost estimations in the literature and finds the effect of water cost on irrigation water demand. Empirical results reveal that: (a) actual average cost is more significant than imputed costs; (2) price elasticities for both extensive and intensive margins are inelastic. This study also sheds lights on appropriate water management, the role of government support program and long-term sustainability. </h3>
